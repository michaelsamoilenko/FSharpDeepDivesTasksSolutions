# F# Deep Dives Tasks Solutions
F# Deep Dives is a brilliant [book](https://www.manning.com/books/f-sharp-deep-dives) that suggests solutions to various problems based on F# language and using it idioms. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/tpetricek/DeepDives)

I did solve a few of them. My solutions aren't full, aren't perfect and that was just for fun. I didn't leave a lot of comments in my code because it becomes pretty clear what task I was solving if you read the chapter. Also sometimes in the chapter tasks are interleaved with each other so that's why it's hard to define some nice flow of having codeblocks and comments specific for concrete task. But I hope it might be useful for somebody else when they'll be working on that tasks. Feel free to contribute to this repo with your solutions you can either enhance mines or just place yours next to it
